# Fall 2022 - Shopify Developer Intern Challenge Question

## Step 1. TASK

Build an inventory tracking web application for a logistics company. We are looking for a web application that meets the requirements listed below, along with one additional feature, with the options also listed below.

You can tackle this challenge using any technology you want. This is an open-ended task, but we want to focus on high quality back-end code. Custom UIs and interactive frameworks like React are not necessary. Ideally, the web application can run within 15 minutes.

Please provide instructions on how to use your application. There is no guarantee that a reviewer will be completely familiar with your language, framework, IDE or development environment. Please provide step by step instructions on how to get your application running. Don’t assume any technologies exist in the reviewer's environment. 

Information: You can use frameworks, libraries and external dependencies to help you get to the parts you are interested in building, if this helps you; or start from scratch. When building, consider how more features could be added in the future.

For the weather information you can use any free weather provider such as [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/). Note that you may be required to register to get an API token; registration is free.

## Requirements

- Basic CRUD Functionality. You should be able to:

  - Create inventory items
  - Edit Them
  - Delete Them
  - View a list of them

- Additional requirements:
  - Each inventory item should be associated with a city where the item is stored
  - There are only 5 possible cities used for storage, which can be hard-coded into the application
  - The list of items in the inventory must include the city and a simple textual description of the current weather


- ONLY ONE OF THE FOLLOWING (We will only evaluate the first feature chosen, so please only choose one)

  - Push a button export product data to a CSV
  - Allow image uploads AND store image with generated thumbnails
  - When deleting, allow deletion comments and undeletion
  - Filtering based on fields/inventory count/tags/other metadata
  - Ability to assign/remove inventory items to a named group/collection
  - Ability to create warehouses/locations and assign inventory to specific locations
  - Ability to create “shipments” and assign inventory to the shipment, and adjust inventory appropriately
  - Ability to generate a report on inventory levels over time, like: most in-stock or out-of-stock last month
  - Allow for any city in the world to be used as a storage location


- Authentication and CSS/Design are not required and will not be considered during evaluation.

## Step 2: Run the app on Replit

Now that you have built your code in GitHub, you will import the project to replit where you will run the application

- Create a Replit account and follow the instructions (you can use the YouTube video) on how to get started
- Once you have created your account, link your GitHub challenge link to your Riplit account
